  dialogue:
  - This painting really speaks to me. Like deep down this painting was always apart
    of me. The description spoke about "space" and progression, wonder what it meant.
  - 'I heard there''s a second painting of this style was made as well, I think from
    memory it was titled "I can interact with every object in this world", sounds
    deep '
