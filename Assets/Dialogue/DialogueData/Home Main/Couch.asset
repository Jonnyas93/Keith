  dialogue:
  - I never really liked this couch, I mean if you are sitting on the end closest
    to the TV you are both going to go blind but also not see whats happening
  - But I also don't have the heart to just get rid of it. So many great memories
    were had sitting right here on this couch
  - The chips eaten, the naps taken, the games played, the hours spent finding the
    remote when I just had it right next to me. Good times
