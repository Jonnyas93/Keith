  - 'Ah the amount of office hours I''ve wasted because of this thing.

    Its a
    cycle you see, Workplace Health and Safetly asks for workers

    to not be seated
    longer than 30 minutes without a break.'
  - "So every 30 minutes, I go get a cup of water. Of course those \nwaters add up
    and I will obviously have to... dispose of that liquid eventually. "
  - "Therefore mathematically, water time plus pee time equals me \nwasting much
    of the business's time and still getting paid for it."
